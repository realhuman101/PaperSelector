# Paper Selector

A tool (slightly botched) to randomly select a page from a PDF (typically the PDF will contain all past papers) to complete.

## Usage/Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Upload your PDF (NAME IT `Full_Paper.pdf`) with all your past papers to the main directory in this repository
4. Run the program with `python main.py`
5. Your randomly selected page will be in the `currentPage.pdf` file
